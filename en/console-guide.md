### Create Storage

New storage is created. The created storage can be accessed from instances by using the network file system (NFS) protocol.

| Item | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Name | Name of the storage to be created. The NFS access path can be created with the storage name. Storage name is limited to less than 100 alphabetic characters, numbers, and some symbols ('-', '_'). |
| Description | A description for storage |
| Size | Size of the storage to be created. It can be entered from a minimum of 300 GB to a maximum of 10,000 GB. |
| VPC | The virtual private cloud (VPC) to access the storage. |
| Subnet | The subnet to access the storage. Only subnets in the selected VPC can be chosen. |
| Access Control List (ACL) | A list of the IPs or CIDR blocks that allow read and write permissions. |
| Auto Create Snapshot | Snapshots are created automatically at a specified time once per day. When the maximum number of saves is reached, the first automatically created snapshot is deleted.  |
| Snapshot Storage  | If the sum of the snapshot capacity exceeds the set size, the first created snapshot among all snapshots is deleted. |

> [Note] 
> The number of subnets available for each project is limited to 3 as of March 2023. To increase the limit, contact the Customer Center.

The default search period is the latest 1 hour, and you can search any period you want through the search period filter. Descriptions of monitoring metrics are found in the table below.

| Metric | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage capacity | byte | Display the total capacity of storage and the capacity in use. |
| Storage usage | % | Display the capacity in use as a percentage of the total storage capacity. |
| IOPS | OPS | Display storage operations per second. |
| Latency | usec | Display storage latency time. |
| Snapshot number | - | Display the number of snapshots in storage. |
| Snapshot capacity | byte | Display the amount of capacity that storage is using for the snapshot. |
| Inode | - | Display the number of storage inodes. |
| Storage status | - | Display storage status. |

* Debian, Ubuntu: nfs-common, rpcbind
  ```
  sudo apt-get install nfs-common rpcbind
  ```
* CentOS: nfs-utils, rpcbind
  ```
  sudo yum install nfs-utils rpcbind
  ```

#### Run rpcbind Service 

```
sudo service rpcbind start
```

#### Mount NAS Storage

```
sudo mount -t nfs {nas source} {mount point}
```

* nas source: NAS storage information 
Example) 192.168.0.241:/data
* mount point: Directory on which NAS storage is mounted 
Example) /mnt
